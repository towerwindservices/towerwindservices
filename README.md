My personal web site, using the awesome design of http://html5up.net/spectral by
the talented [@ajlkn](http://twitter.com/ajlkn).

I morphed that design into this Jekyll [theme](#theme-note) for blog and portfolio entries.
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, which
uses templates to generate all the publishable content as static
HTML files (as opposed to something like WordPress, which has files that pull
data from a database at runtime).
This repo is the exact same code I use for my site (excluding my posts and
some data files created from templates where noted).

## Theme note
This is a theme in the old sense of the word. This is not a newer _gem-based_ theme (yet).
